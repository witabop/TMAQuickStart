# Statement Creation

Statement writing is essential to **TMA TTRPG**. Each person will write a statement in a semi-rotating order. For example, Player 1 will write one session's statement, then Player 2 the next, and so on. Occasionally I will take over statement writing to introduce critical plot threads—but the rotation order will resume unchanged once the I'm done writing those statements.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Choose a Fear to Explore
Base your statement around a common fear. Choose from the list below or invent a variation:

- **Death and Eternity** – Fear of what comes after.
- **Entombment and The Ground Beneath Us** – Claustrophobia, burial, suffocation, or soil-bound corruption.
- **The Other and That Which You Do Not Know** – Uncanny beings or warped identity.
- **A Distorted Reality and The Fraying Mind** – Madness, dreams, or perception collapse.
- **The Falling Titan and The Endless Sky** – Vastness, space, deep sea, or massive entities.
- **The Rot That Spreads Unfettered and That Which Crawls Unseen** – Plague and infestation.
- **The Distant Watcher** – Paranoia and surveillance.
- **A Formidable Hunter and The Chase that Follows** – Fear of pursuit and being prey.
- **The Unseen Hand and A Great Web** – Manipulation, puppetry, spiders.
- **Violence Without Reason** – Random mania, war, senseless acts.
- **The Flesh We Occupy and That of Others** – Bodily horror and anatomical strangeness.
- **A Faceless Crowd and The Town Without People** – Isolation, vanishing, or erasure.
- **Untold Suffering and a Great Loss** – Pain, Grief, despair, irreversible change.
- **Darkness and an Unlit World** – Fear of the dark.

### 2. Name and Number the Statement
- Give your statement a name (**4 words or fewer**). Example: *“Eye Contact”*, *“Dig”*, *“Strange Music”*
- Format the **statement number** as `#YYYDDMM`
- Include the **date**, **author**, and their context

**Example:**  
`#0021012 Thousand Pursuers`

### 3. Write the Statement (1st Person)
- Length: ~5 minutes to read
- Voice: First-person account
- Context: Who is this person? Why are they reporting this?
- Build-Up: What events led to the incident?
- Encounter: What supernatural or unexplainable thing occurred?
- Escape: How did they survive?
- Statement End: Why now? Why the Institute?
- Optional: Brief footnote on any **early follow-up by the Institute (THIS SHOULD NOT BE MUCH)**

### 4. Hook the Party
- Ensure there are **leads** to investigate
- Include **locations**, **objects**, or **unresolved questions**
- I will add edits or lore hooks as needed

## Sample Statement

### `#0021012 Thousand Pursuers`
**Given on 12/10/2002 by Police Constable Wayne Thompson**

> "I’d like to preface this by saying I don’t scare easy. Never have. Been on the force for over twenty years now. Domestic violence calls, house fires, even helped pull a gruesome looking kid out of a well during the floods in '98. I’ve seen fear, real fear—but what happened last month… it wasn’t fear. It was something older. Something patient.
>
> The town of Ashford is a small one, tucked away in a more rural part or Norwich. Population just under 900. Everyone knows everyone, and change isn’t exactly welcome here. So when a man we didn’t recognize checked into the old Northridge boarding house, let's just say folks took notice. He was tall. Impossibly tall. Six-foot-eight, maybe taller. Wiry, but with hands like root bundles. His face was long, pale, hair neatly combed, and his clothes... they looked like they’d never been wrinkled. Slate grey three-piece suit, thin black tie, no coat, even when the frost hit.
>
> He didn’t talk much. Just nodded at people and wandered. He never bought anything. Didn’t eat at the diner, didn’t pick up supplies at Henson’s. He just... observed. Always standing a little too still. Always watching something just past the horizon.
>
> Within days, things started changing. I mean small things at first. Dogs around town began to start attacking eachother in such cruel ways it almost seemed impossible to be done purely instinctually. I can't tell you the amount of dog fights I had to break up during this time that resulted in pools of blood seeping into the cracks of concrete below where it had taken place. My neighbour, old Mrs. Leary, started baking meat pies again even though she hadn't since her son died. Said she’d had a dream which told her to, when she said this her eyes seemed to sharpen suddenly. I asked what she meant but she wouldn’t say more.
>
> Then came the bigger changes. Conversations got quieter. Eye contact got longer, sharper. People forgot street names they’d known all their lives. One kid at the high school, Jamie Leeds, said he didn’t recognize his own mother’s face. And she didn’t seem to mind.
>
> I saw him again, that man, outside the primary school. Just watching the playground. His face was... blank. Not cold. Just absent, waiting for something maybe? I walked up to him, told him he couldn’t loiter around kids. He looked me in the eyes and said, ‘Not here for them.’ and gave me a long toothy smile that I could've swore brandished several sharp rows of teeth.
>
> I blinked and he was gone. Just gone.
>
> That night, something cracked. I woke up to a noise—hundreds of feet scuffling against pavement. My radio was static. I grabbed my torch, stepped outside, and the street was full. People. All of them. Just standing there. My neighbours, the mailman, a girl I arrested last year for arson. Silent. Faces slack. Clothes rumpled like they’d dressed in a rush, some still in their pajamas. No sound except breathing. Heavy. Synchronized.
>
> Then they started walking toward me in such a way calm, yet feirce way. I walk I knew all to well. Every last one of them wanted me dead.
>
> I ran. I’ve never run like that before. I cut through yards, vaulted fences, and everywhere I turned—there they were. Moving slow, never rushing, but never stopping to seemingly toy with me. 
>
> Eventually I made it to the butcher’s and broke through the back and managed to lock myself in the freezer before any of them could follow me inside. It was -4°C and pitch black, but at least I could breathe. I stayed in there until the hum of voices and footsteps died.
>
> The next morning? Sun was shining. Streets clean. Nobody remembered anything. Nobody even asked why I didn’t show up to work.
>
> That man? Gone. The boarding house manager said she’d never seen him. But the room at the top of the stairs still smells like smoke and pennies. And every now and then, I still see one of those townsfolk sharpen their gaze... like a predator gazing upon its prey."

> *An initial follow up could not be conductged with Mr. Thompson himself as he was found deceased in his flat 1/15/2003, seemingly torn to shreds in such a violent manner that coroners have ruled out murder, stating "Wounds are far too vicious to have been not been inflicted by a wild animal".*
